# Description of JP Project


This is a work in progress, I am working on this project throughout the semester and will complete steps throughout each week. The goal of 
this project is to design a template in Java for creating and recording all future production item. When the project is finished, it will
create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line. This structure would then allow easy modification to handle 
different products.

# Classes with Descriptions
* Class: Main - Main class that allows the program to run
* Class: Widget -  A subclass of the Product class, the widget class will name the different products. Starting with widget 1 and increasing
* Abstract Class: Product - Will implement the basic functionality that all items on a production line should have
* Interface: Item - Contains constant methods that every "Item" would need to contain
* Enum: ItemType - Contains the constants that represent the different types of items available for production
